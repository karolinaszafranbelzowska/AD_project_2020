4.1 MySQL
Import the world database from world.sql to MySQL 
•	MySQL Workbench
To  import the world database from world.sql to MySQL I am using MySQL Workbench.
Open MySQL Workbench  => Server  => Data Import  => Import from self-Contained File  =>
Click and find the location where it is on my computer  => start import  =>  open new SQL query tab and type “SHOW DATABASES;”  (When I run it I can see what databases are in world.sql).
•	Command prompt (cmder)
Type commands in cmder prompt:
1.	cd “\Program Files”
2.	cd MySQL
3.	cd MySQL Server 8.0
4.	cd bin
 
5.	Then type commad as follows:
mysql -u (here is my root name) -p(here is my password to my root) < "C:\Users\karolina\Desktop\AD_project_2020\world.sql"  (enter)

                                I give the whole path to the file here
6.	I can go back to MySQL Workbench and I can run “SHOW DATABASES;” and world database is there.
 

The world database is imported.
I can see what  tables are in the world database by typing:
1.	use world; (ctrl + enter)
2.	show tables; (ctrl + enter)
The same commands I can type in MySQL 8.0 Command Line Client.
